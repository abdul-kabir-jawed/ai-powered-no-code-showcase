# 🚀 AI-Powered No-Code Portfolio

A living collection of my **no-code websites & apps**, all built with the power of **AI as a skill**.  
This isn’t about building AI itself — it’s about **using AI smartly** to create, automate, and solve real problems.

> **In the age of AI, survival isn’t about hard work.  
> It’s about knowing how to make AI work for you.**

## 🌟 Why AI Skills Matter

AI isn’t just the future — **it’s the present survival kit**.  
Learning to **leverage AI for your own benefit** is like learning to use the internet back in the 90s:  
those who adapt, thrive. Those who don’t, fall behind.

> **“AI won’t replace you.  
> People who use AI will.”**

I treat AI as a **core skill** — one that I’ve studied, practiced, and mastered to get things done faster, smarter, and better.
